        Dr Stephen Mullin is <a
        href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/stephen-mullin">Associate
        Professor of Neurology at UoP</a> and <a
        href="https://www.plymouthhospitals.nhs.uk/neurology">Consultant
        Neurologist at UHPNT</a>. Much of his research career has been spent
        predicting and stratifying risk of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using clinical
        and genomic biomarkers. His work now focuses on risk stratification and
        early diagnosis neurological diseases based on routinely collected
        data, including an <a href="https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/">UKRI
        MRC</a> supported project which aims to stratify future risk of <a
        href="https://plymouth-neuroimaging.github.io/projects/2023/10/11/stroke.html">stroke</a>.
        He is a member of the Health Research Authority <a
        href="https://www.hra.nhs.uk/about-us/committees-and-services/confidentiality-advisory-group/">Confidentiality
        Advisory Group (CAG)</a> and the <a
        href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/explore-nihr/funding-programmes/health-technology-assessment.htm">NIHR
        Health Technology Assessment</a> Advisory Group. He is the UoP Faculty
        of Health lead for the group.

        {% capture intro_michael_allen %}
        Mike is a Senior Research Fellow in Applied Healthcare Modelling and
        Data Science in the <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/">University of Exeter Medical School</a>. After nearly
        20 years in Pharma R&D Drug Discovery, he switched to academia to focus
        on research that maximises NHS benefits from new treatments. He has a
        life-long interest in combining biomedical and computer sciences, and
        believes we're now living in the age that he so looked forward to -
        where computer science ('AI') is matching biomedical science in what it
        can offer to medicine.

        Currently his work mostly involves looking at variation in healthcare
        between hospitals, looking at what different hospitals do differently,
        and how that affects patient outcomes. He uses modelling and AI to ask
        the question "What would happen if my patient went to another hospital?
        What would they do, and what would the patient outcome be?"
